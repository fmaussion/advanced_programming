## git exercise 1: a typical workflow for a 1 person project

"due date": 21.03.2022

0. Don't forget to setup git as explained here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup

1. Create an account on one of:
    - https://github.com
    - https://gitlab.com
    - https://git.uibk.ac.at

    Take your decision on the platform based on what you want the account for, and the topics we have discussed 
    in class. If you are not sure, simply use git.uibk.ac.at (this is what we will use for exercise 2 anyways).

2. Create a new repository of your choice *online*. Name it what you want (test something)

3. Clone it locally on your laptop

4. Add one file or two, add some content to the files. Commit them.

5. Changes the files a bit more, commit again.

6. Now push the changes to your online repository.

7. Online now, edit one of the files with the online editor. Commit the changes online.

8. Pull the changes locally, so that the changes that happened online are now available locally.

That's it! You've already learned a bunch about git with only just this workflow!
