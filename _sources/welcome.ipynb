    "- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is THE place for programming questions. Thanks to community based moderation rules, the good questions are more visible than bad ones, and good answers are rewarded. [Take a tour](https://stackoverflow.com/tour) of the site's principles, and look for similar questions before asking your own one.\n",

    "- If you think you discovered a bug, than report it to the library directly. Almost all the scientific python packages are hosted on GitHub: the \"issues\" tab is where to report bugs. Read the excellent [Craft Minimal Bug Reports](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports) article from Matt Rocklin before doing so."
